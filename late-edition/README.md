# Late Edition

A noir RTS where the player runs a 1940s newspaper that's a front for an
information empire. Deploy reporters across a fog-soaked city, convert leads
into stories, hit the print deadline every 12 in-game minutes, and defend the
press from rival papers and crime bosses. Build → defend → upgrade fused with
resource optimization on a print-cycle clock.

## Status

**v0.1.0 — milestone 0.1 (world render scaffold).** First playable code:
scene, camera, toon pipeline, fog, rain, ground grid. Lifted from the feel
test, scoped to ICD-01 only. No game logic yet. Next milestone is **0.2**
(A* pathfinding · Reporter unit · click-to-dispatch). See
[`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## How to navigate

1. Open `index.html` in a browser (or click the **Late Edition** card from the
   arcade launcher). You'll see the cel-shaded world scaffold — an empty
   paper-colored ground with a street grid, falling rain, viewed through an
   orthographic isometric camera.
2. The in-page **Phase 0 + Roadmap →** link (top-right of the scene) opens
   the architectural supplement (also reachable directly at
   [`design/phase-0-roadmap.html`](design/phase-0-roadmap.html)).
3. Read [`roadmap.md`](roadmap.md) for the milestone list in plain markdown.
4. Read [`architecture/00-overview.md`](architecture/00-overview.md) for the
   strong/medium/fuzzy banding in markdown.
5. Open the [`icds/`](icds) directory for the five interface contracts (01,
   02, 03, 05, 06) that gate the next code sessions; ICD-04 is deferred to
   PRE-0.8.

## Tech stack (planned)

- **three.js** (via ES module CDN) for cel-shaded toon 3D — MeshToonMaterial,
  3-step gradient map, EdgesGeometry outlines @ 25°, linear fog 22→60.
- **Orthographic isometric** camera, WASD pan, click-to-dispatch.
- **localStorage JSON** for saves (one versioned blob).
- **Browser-only, single-player MVP.** No backend, no netcode, no auth.

Architecture must not foreclose later multiplayer / cloud saves / procedural
city generation — those are post-MVP. See
[`architecture/00-overview.md`](architecture/00-overview.md) for the fuzzy band.

## Design package

The four design HTMLs in [`design/`](design) are the **source of truth** —
authored in Claude Design (claude.ai/design), checked in unchanged. The
markdown docs in this directory mirror specific sections for code-session use;
when the two disagree, the source HTML wins.

- [`design/design-doc.html`](design/design-doc.html) — the master design doc
  (pitch, visual system, world, core loop, resources, buildings, units,
  rivals, defense, tech tree, camera/HUD/audio, three.js notes, story engine,
  balancing, decisions locked, still-TBD).
- [`design/phase-0-roadmap.html`](design/phase-0-roadmap.html) — **Supplement
  B**, this page. Architecture banding, ICDs, roadmap, paper-vs-design
  triage, Monday plan.
- [`design/rival-ai-spec.html`](design/rival-ai-spec.html) — **Supplement
  A**. State machines for Herald / Evening Star / Observer, transition
  tables, interaction matrix, difficulty curve, pseudocode.
- [`design/audio-manifest.html`](design/audio-manifest.html) — **Supplement
  C**. 60 audio prompts: 6 ambient beds, 6 music stems, 24 SFX, 60 VO lines,
  phased to milestones.
